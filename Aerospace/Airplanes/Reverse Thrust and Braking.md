Commercial airliners have a piece of engine cowling that translates aft and directs engine airflow into a honeycomb structure (a cascade) that reverses the direction of the high-speed engine exhaust by 180 degrees to slow down the plane. 

An engineering challenge is to ensure that the hot air is directed away from the engine in order to avoid premature fatigue [[Fracture Theory]].
