**Airfoil Nomenclature**
* #meancamberline : the locus of points halfway between the upper and lower surfaces as measured perpendicular to the mean camber line itself. 
* #leadingedge : the most forward point of the #meancamberline
* #trailingedge : the most rearward point of the #meancamberline 
* #chordline : the straight line connecting the #leadingedge and #trailingedge of the airfoil
* #chordc : The presice distance from the leading to the trailing edge measured along the chord line of the airfoil
* #camber : the maximum distance between the mean camber line and the chord line, measured perpendicular to the chord line. 
* #thickness : the distance between the upper and lower surfaces, which is also measured perpendicular to the chord line. 
* #symmetricairfoil : An airfoil which has no #camber (camber line and chord line coincident) **Mostly used in aerobatic airplanes**

When designing airfoils, the design life coefficient is the theoretical lift coefficient for the airfoil when the angle of attack is such that the slope of the #meancamberline is parallel to #freestreamvelocity 

**Standard Airfoil Geometries:**
The shape of the #leadingedge is typically circular, with a radius of approximately 0.02c. 

**NACA Airfoils**
*NACA Airfoils have a standard nomenclature that they developed until 1949, which can be used for reference, however, memorizing the numbering system is not necessary*
