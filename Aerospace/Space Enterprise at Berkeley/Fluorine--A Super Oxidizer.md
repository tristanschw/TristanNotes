#Ignition, #Flox, #Cryogenics

#Flox is a mixture of liquid fluorine with liquid oxygen

Liquid fluorine work started about the same time as the liguid hydrogen work at JPL, but fluorine was remarkably unavailable. 

It was first burned with gaseous hydrogen, but then it was successfully fired with liquid hydrogen.

**Liquid Fluorine Fun Facts**
	- Super oxidizer
	- reacts under proper conditions with everything (hypergolic) except nitrogen, which can immensely promote [[Specific Impulse]]
	- EXTREMELY TOXIC
	- Can be contained in steal, copper, aluminum because of the formation of metal fluoride which prevents any further reaction; however, if the metal fluoride layer is scrubbed off somehow, the results can be spectacular (from a distance)
	- 	**Question to ask, if a fuel is hypergolic, is a [[Hard start]] possible?**
	
**Fluorine Motors**
- Rocketdyne: Nomad, 12,000 pound fluorine x hydrazine
- Bell: Chariot, 35,000 pound fluorine x monomethyl hydrazine x water x hydrazine for Titan 3
- GE: X-430, 75,000 pound fluorine x hydrazine

End Note: Fluorine is likely not ever to be used for big boosters, since the burned into hydrofluorides (HF) is rough on equipment, people and very expensive. However, for deep space work, fluorine x hydrogen may be the answer!
