From **Ignition!** by *John D. Clark*

Rocket performance is not usually reported in terms of exhaust velocity, although the early workers wrote in those terms. Instead, it is reported as #specificimpulse , $I_s$ , which is the exhaust velocity divided by the standard acceleration of gravity. This gives figures of a convenient size in the range of 200 to 400 or so.

Another way to describe #specificimpulse is the the velocity expressed in units of 9.8 meters per second. This definition retains the concept of mass flow, and doesn't depend upon the local properties of a particular planet.
