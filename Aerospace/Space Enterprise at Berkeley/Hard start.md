[rocketry]
A hard start is a rocketry term referring to an overpressure condition during start of a rocket engine at ignition. In the worst cases, this takes the form of an unconfined explosion, resulting in damage, or destruction of the engine.

Rocket fuels in bipropellant rockets must be introduced to the combustion chamber at the correct rate in order to have a controlled rate of production of hot gas. The occurence of a "hardstart" indicates that the quantity of combustible propellant that entrerd the combustion chamber prior to the irgnition was too large (too much fuel, not enough oxidizer). This leads to an excessive spike of pressure and explosion.
