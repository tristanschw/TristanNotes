The first thing to note about Hot Fire is the objective: to test a liquid bi propellant rocket by pressurizing tanks with both propellant and oxidizer, ignition (via an ignitor, e-motor, or alternative spark) and measurement of the thrust output (via loadcells centered below combustion chamber).

that is of course, what is expected.

So to debunk exactly what occured this weekend, I will explain here:

at 20:00 hours, Friday, Ryan's car with Vamshi, Angela and I arrived at FAR (Friends of Amateur Rocketry) located in the desert of southern California on the trailing edge of the Sierra Nevada. (Just outside of California City, a lovely village). 

WE had been in contact with other drivers, one of which was carrying Eureka 1 and all assemblies (including a hell of a lot of linear actuator assemblies, which were used for automation sequences). His car broke down outside of Bakersfield, at which point there would need to be a rescue mission. 

Ryan, Vamshi ask to borrow a Penske Truck from another collegiate rocketry team (USC, also was testing a bi-prop set up). They successfully returned the rocket at 5:00 hours on Saturday morning. Sleepless night indeed.

Following morning begins at 6:00hours, Ben leads avionics, begins assembly (of which we are behind on, as we wanted to set up in the evening the night before) of the avionics. Remaining tasks were to validate all linear actuator conditions for automated fill and release. 

Ben detects issue with one avionics board, main, and see that the teensy (microcontrooler) was overheating. It was confirmed that the microcontroller was dead and a new one would need to be used. Borrow from Vamshi. Broke again. Found another??

After transit to the test beam located roughly 50 yards from the hangar, the stand was immediately lifted vertical. Some misalignment occured between the test beam and base plate, which caused some of the screw to misalign. The solution was to ratchet strap the top end (assumed to be a low force zone). The high winds and blowing sand made it unideal to be on a ladder, but systems setups and debugging occured with some teammembers on a forklift, others standing on a ladder. Dewars were transported near 13:00 hours and strapped to a secure location. 

At 14:00 hours and a grueling day of sun and sand, the system is go for system checks. Cryoteam begins prechill of system tanks and propane fill. Halfway through system checks, FAR attendees are called to the bunkers for a system hotfire of USC bi-prop (successful, 800lbsforce thrust (which is theoretical output of E1)). Due to the wait, cryoteam and avionics began prechill again, and began fill with liquid oxygen. HIGHLY COMBUSTIBLE. At 15:00hours, the system count down begins, 5-4-3-2-1 valves open, high pressure solenoid open and gases begin entering combustion chamber. Ignitor error causes unusually loci for spark. High concentration of oxygen and propane outside of combustion chamber ignites (in one frame) and explodes bottom portion.

It was assumed that the ignitor played a role in the explosion. All valves and linear actuators behaved correctly, and it was deemed that the ignitor may have been pushed aside upon valve opening due to gas thrust . This caused the ignitor to misalign, creating a delay in proper ignition. It was this delay that caused the influx of propane x oxygen outside of the combustion chamber which led to the explosion. However, this may not be entirely accurate and more discussion is needed to elaborate on the full cause of E1 Hotfire Accident (which some considered a [[Hard start]]. #hardstart, #seb, #ignitorfailure #hotfire, #firsthotfire
