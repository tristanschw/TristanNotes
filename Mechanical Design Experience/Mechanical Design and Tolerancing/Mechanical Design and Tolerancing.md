In this section, I discuss various practices of design, tolerancing, machining. This includes but is not limited to design conventions, such as screw sizes in metric and imperial, tolerancing conventions, including datums, hole and pin tolerances, and proper dimensioning, and finally, 2D drawing conventions for machinists.
