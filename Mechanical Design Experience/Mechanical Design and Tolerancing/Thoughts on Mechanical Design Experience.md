The Idea is not to have a finished project, but the process by which was imployed to design and iterate on the idea at hand


That being said,
Much of the mechanical design experience should showcase the work that I have done, including but not limited to design, programming, GD&T, tolerancing and mechatronics features. 

They should not entail any measure of complete "physical" developments, since this methodology occupies a tremendous time, financial, and hardware constraints. 

One can design a project, iterate, and "complete" strictly by the basis of being an idea on paper--not a physical product.

In the end, the interviewer wants to know what you've learned about the project. Not the bugs you fixed, not the largest issues associated with the project, but the thought process which you used to accomplish the features of the project and measure of accuracy and ability. 

However, that being said the balance of a clever engineer is that of a designer, simulator, and envisioner, and that of test, experimentation, and optimization. 

The two are different, an effective engineer should balance both: design experience and application.

For the shear fact that design is shaped upon theory, which does not balance to the real world, chaotic, imperfect nature that is engineering application.
