Screw threads serve three basic functions:
1. provide a clamping force
2. restrict or control motion
3. transmit power

The distance the point moves linear (parallel to the axis) in one revolution is referred to as pitch or lead.

The size most commonly associated with screw threads is the #nominaldiameter. #Nominaldiameter is a more of a label than a size. *For example, a bolt and nut may be described as being ½” diameter. But neither the external threads of the bolt nor the internal threads of the nut are exactly .500 in diameter.*

The size of a metric screw or bolt is specified as diameter, pitch and length, in millimeters (millimeters is abbreviated "mm"). 

**M8-1.0 x 20**

M = Metric thread designation

8 = Nominal diameter, in millimeters

1.0 = Pitch (distance from thread to thread), in millimeters

20 = Length, in millimeters _(see below)_

For nuts, size will appear as diameter and pitch. There is an exception though—if pitch isn't specified, the fastener is #coarsethread

#coarsethread screws may appear like this:

M12 x 25 = 12 mm diameter, coarse thread is assumed (1.75 mm), 25 mm long
M12 is a matching coarse threaded nut
