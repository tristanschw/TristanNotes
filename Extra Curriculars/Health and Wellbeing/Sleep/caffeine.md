Levels of caffeine peak after thirty minutes of consumption. Caffeine's half-life is five to seven hours.

Non-caffeinated or decaf coffee, still has caffeine (typically 15-30% of normal coffee)

Caffeine is removed from your system by an enzyme in the liver called the cytochrome which metabolizes (gradually degrades) caffeine over time. 

The rate at which the cytochrome may metabolizes is largely genetic which allows the liver to rapidly clear caffeine from the bloodstream. For others, one cup of coffee or tea may last for the entire day.

The way caffeine keeps you awake is by interrupting the sleep pressure chemical, adenosine, from latching on to receptors in the brain.
