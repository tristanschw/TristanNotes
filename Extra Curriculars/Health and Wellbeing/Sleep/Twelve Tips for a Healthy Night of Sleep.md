[[Why Do We Sleep]][[Sleep and Behavior]][[Sleep and Learning]]
1. Stick to a sleep schedule. Set an alarm to go to sleep, not to get up in the morning. (Unless you yourself have issues getting up in the morning.) A schedule is the best thing to ensure that you get a full night of sleep every night. 
2. Exercise, but do not do it 3-4 hours before bedtime. 
3. Avoid [[caffeine]], nicotine, and other stimulants. 
	1. Nicotine especially affects sleep cycles because it is a stimulant, causing light sleep, and often causes early rises because of nicotine withdrawl.
4. Avoid alcoholic drinks before bed. Heavy drinks before bed will rob you of REM sleep, and might wake you up in the middle of the night when the alcohol wears off.
5. Avoid large meals and beverages, because indegestion can affect sleep. Drinking too many fluids may also disrupt sleep.
6. Avoid some medicines that may cause insomnia. 
7. Try not to nap after 3pm, as this will likely make it harder to fall asleep at night abiding by the same schedule.
8. Relax and unwind before bed. Don't overschedule your day so that you have no time to unwind at the end of the day. Reading, listening to music. All are great things for a good night sleep. 
9. Take a hot bath or shower before bed, as the drop in body temperature will promote sleeping.
10. Dark, cool, gadget-free bedroom.
11. Have the right daylight exposure. Get outside!
12. Don't lie in bed awake, if you can't fall asleep after twenty minutes, restart your relaxing activity.
