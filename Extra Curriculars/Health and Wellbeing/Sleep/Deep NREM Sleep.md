Deep #NREM sleep helps by allowing the glymphtic system remove dangerous metabolic contaminants generated by neurons during the day. This system is most active at night, where glial cells decrease in size, which opens room for cerebral spinal fluid to flush out metabolic refuse.

One of the contaminants removed during this state of slumber is the amyloid protein, which is a poisonous element associated with Alzheimer's. See [[Sleep and Old Age]]
