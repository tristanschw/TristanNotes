Excerpts from [[Why Do We Sleep]]
#mathewwalker #sleep 

**Sleep Before Learning**
Two groups are examined, a sleeping and sleep deprivation group, that is one which slept all night and one which pulled an all-nighter.
The next day, participants were placed in an MRI scanner and quizzed to learn new facts.
Those which pulled an all-nighter showed a 40% deficit in the ability to cram new facts into the brain. MRI Scanning also showed that sleep deprived individuals had next to no activity in the #hypocampus , the memory inbox of the brain. 

**Sleep After Learning**
Aids in the consolidation and offline cementation of recently learned memories. 
Participants learned a visual memory, then some groups were granted one full night of sleep, two, three. One outlier group was given one all-nighter after learning, and two full nights of sleep to recover. The outlier group showed no evidence of memory consolidation improvement. 

*if you don't sleep the very first night after learning, you lose the chance to consolidate those memories, even if you get lots of catch-up sleep afterwards.*
