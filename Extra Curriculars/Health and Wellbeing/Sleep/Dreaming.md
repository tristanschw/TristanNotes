**What Dreaming Does:**
"Like an insightful interviewer, dreaming takes the approach of interrogating our recent autobiographical experience and skillfully positioning it within the context of past experiences and accompishments, **building a rich tapestry of meaning**"


**How can I understand and connect that 
**As REM sleep takes hold, there are four main clusters in the brain that spark.**
1. The visuospatial regions at the back of the brain
2. The motor cortex 
3. The hippocampus
4. Deep emotional centers of the brain (the amygdala and cingulate cortex$^{1}$)
	$^{1}$ These regions are 30% more active during the nighttime than during the daytime.
**What is Not Active During REM**
1. The Prefrontal Cortex (described as the CEO of the brain, which manages logic, rational thought, and reasoning.)

**Dreaming helps with traumatic stress events by desensitizing (de-emotionalizing) their renenactments.**

**Dreaming has an essential function towards [[Creativity]]

**Dreaming and [[Problem Solving]]**
