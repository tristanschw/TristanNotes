**Am I Getting Enough Sleep?**

After waking up in the morning, could you fall back asleep at ten or eleven a.m.? Y/N

*If yes, you are likely not getting sufficient sleep quantity and/or quality.*

Can you function optimally without caffeine before noon? Y/N

*If no, you are likely self medicating your state of chronic sleep deprivation.*

**The Flow of Sleep Deprivation:**
By remaining awake, and blocking access  to the adenosine drain which sleep opens up, the brain is unable to rid itself of chemical sleep pressure (caused by #adenosine, and recall that [[caffeine]] "blocks" this drain by hogging receptors).

A person's circadian rhythm is consistent, typically a 24 hour cycle independent of #adenosine concentrations.

High concentrations of #adenosine lead to an increased desire to sleep and turn down wake-promoting regions of the brain.

We are awake and productive individuals for 2/3 of our lives.

A recent study also compounded that patients can manipulate the strength of their deep sleep state (NREM) by using external memory boosters in the form of sound or minute electrical pulses. The strength of these methods has shown an unusual affect in increasing brain activity, especially selective memory recollection. 

Disrupting #NREM sleep cycles (through sleep distractions with sounds or even sleeping on a plane) can lead to a similar lack of activity in the #hypocampus as pulling an all-nighter.
