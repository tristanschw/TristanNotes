A company in the UK (Edinburgough) is using something they call *Gravity Batteries* to store power as gravitational potential energy. During peak demand, a weight lowers towards the ground, charging an electric generator, and feeding power into the grid. During off ours, the weight is raised. 

The principle is similar to well-acclaimed hydro-electric power, except has the option to store energy from wind.
