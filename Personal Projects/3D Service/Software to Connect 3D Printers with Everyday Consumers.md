Initial Questions:

1. What is the market potential?
2. Are there any competitors? What exists right now?
3. How can we make it something that everyday people will use, even if they don't know anything about 3D printing?

Tester:

Do you or anyone you know have a broken door handle, a part missing on a snow-blower, a missing arm on a glove box, or a blown gasket that can't be sourced from a supplier?

Don't pay double the price for a rare part. Have students print it for you! 3D printing is a great and reliable way to manufacture a couple parts you need.

If you're getting started on a new project this summer and need a fixture or custom jig to hold an assembly, or you just need a plastic door catch that won't break in the winter--send a drawing of what you have in mind. I'll design it, print it, and send it to you! 

Best thing...If it sucks, keep your money, just give me feedback to help me improve.

Here's a couple pictures of prints I've made in the past for myself and people in my network.
