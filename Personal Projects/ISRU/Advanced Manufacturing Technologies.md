Project: AMT: a public private collaboration involving other government agencies that include the Department of Defense, Department of Energy, Department of Commerce (NIST), NASA, the National Science Foundation, Department of Education, and Department of Agriculture.

Objective: Develop and mature innovative, low-cost manufacturing processes and products including:
1. metallic joining, 
2. AM
3. composites
4. digital manufacturing
5. Current technologies advancing under AMT are:
**Low Cost Upper Stage-Class Propulsion Development (LCUSP)** – The LCUSP project is using additive manufacturing to develop high pressure/high temperature combustion chambers and nozzles with copper and nickel alloys.

**Additive Construction for Mobile Emplacement (ACME**) – [[ACME]] is developing technology to build structures on planetary surfaces using in situ resources. The project focuses on the construction of both 2D (landing pads, roads, and structure foundations) and 3D (habitats, garages, radiation shelters, and other structures) infrastructure needs for planetary surface missions.
