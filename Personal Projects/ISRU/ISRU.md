**In-Space Resource Utilization**

Initial Questions:

What is the commercial potential?

What are the current plans? Are they legit?

How much investment? What would be the cost?

What can be mined? Where?

How to mine? How to bring it back?

How can we build a test plan?


**Current Investments in ISRU by NASA**
Source: https://www.nasa.gov/isru/overview
NASA is directly funding long-term investments to advance ISRU technology in multiple areas including:
1. Regolith-based volatiles resource acquisition and processing

	a. *Developing system technologies to excavate or drill into regolith-based water deposits from various regions on the Moon (see [[Lunar Surface Innovation Initiative]], Mars, and astroids
	
	b. Goal to advance ISRU tech. readiness to provide human commodities including propellant, fuel, cell reactants, and life support consumables*

2. **Regolith-based in-space manufacturing and construction**
 See also: [[Advanced Manufacturing Technologies]]
	a. *Advancing the technology readiness level of 3-D AM construction caapabilities and excation handling tech to produce in-situ feedstock.*
	b. Advance manufacutirng interests to the moon and beyond
	c. Current project: https://gameon.nasa.gov/projects/advanced-manufacturing-technologies/
	
3. Mars atmosphere-based resource acquisition and processsing
	a. *There is water on the Moon and Mars, about as much in Lake Superior according to THIS study (https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=6680)*
	b. Enhanced use of #volatile resources (including methane, ammonia, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide)
