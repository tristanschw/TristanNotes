“My opinion is that public-private partnerships are the ‘secret sauce’ to meeting these very real schedule and capability needs,” Werkheiser said. “I view this as an opportunity for a sort of collaboration where you can create a community that works together and uses each other’s strengths and expertise.”

Project: Lunar Surface Innovation Initiative
Objective:  technology development portfolio to enable human and robotic exploration on the Moon and future operations on Mars.

Priorities:
1. [[ISRU]] to generate products using local materials
	a. **Emphasis on converting lunar ice into drinkable water and other important resources**
2. Utilizing the [[Moon's resources]]
3. Establishing sustainable power during lunar cycles
4. Building machinery and electronics that work in extreme environments (super cold, shadowed craters)
5. Mitigating [[lunar dust]]
6. Carrying out surface [[excavation techniques]], manufacturing and construction
7. Extreme access which includes navigating and exploring the lunar surface and subsurface.
