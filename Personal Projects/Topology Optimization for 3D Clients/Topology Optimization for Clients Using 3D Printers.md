*This idea arrived because I notice few 3D prints actually using topology optimization software (like nTop) because the product hasn't caught on yet*

Case study: Should topology optimization become synonymous with additive manufacturing?

Initial Questions:

What is the potential market?

How can generate topology optimization? Why would it benefit their products?

What does topology optimization do? How many people use it already?
