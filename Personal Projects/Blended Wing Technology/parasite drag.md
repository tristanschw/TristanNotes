[[parasite drag]] is comprised of all the forces that work to slow an aircraft.

"parasite" implies that the drag is not associated with the production of lift, implying that it is drag that occurs at anytime.

[[parasite drag]]includes three types of drag: [[form drag]][[skin friction drag]] and [[interference drag]]
