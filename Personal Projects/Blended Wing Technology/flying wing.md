A [[flying wing]] is a tailles fixed-wing aircraft with no definite fuselage. Everything is housed in the main wing structure. 

*Interesting Pull Out Story From Wiki article that could definitley aid*

*Germany's Hugo Junkers patented his own wing-only air transport concept in 1910. He believed that the flying wing's potentially large internal volume and low drag made it an obvious design for this role. He later began work on a larger aircraft called the Junkers G1, intended to seat passengers within the wing, but was destroyed in 1922 for exceeding postwar size limits on German aircraft imposed by the Allies.*

**Northrop Gruman's Flying Wing Fate:**
*Included the YB-49 and YRB-49* suffered from degraded performance as they entered regions of [[compressible flow]], which led to mission-limiting, and in some cases dangerously divergent, [[longitudinal pitching]], accompanied by combined [[roll-yaw directional instability]]. Only after the advent of digital electronic flying control technology was it possible to damp divergent motions rapidly enough to permit the design of practical transonic flying wing aircraft, exemplified by the Northrop (later Northrop Grumman) B-2A Spirit stealth bomber, which made its first flight in 1989, followed by introduction into operational service in 1997.

**We need tails! Tails help with longitudinal trim and control, with flying wings, everything is coupled on the wings, posing a severe challenge for human pilots**
