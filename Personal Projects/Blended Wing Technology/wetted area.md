The surface area of the aircraft skin. In aircraft, the wetted area is the area which is in contact with the external airflow. This has a direct relationship on the overall aerodynamic drag. of the aircraft

Relation to [[Blended Wing Technology]]: BWB minimizes the total wetted area, which reduces [[skin friction drag]]

In [maritime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maritime_industry "Maritime industry") use, the **wetted area** is the area of the [hull (watercraft)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hull_(watercraft) "Hull (watercraft)") which is immersed in water.

In [motorsport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorsport "Motorsport"), such as [Formula One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One), the term **wetted surfaces** is used to refer to the bodywork, wings and the radiator, which are in direct contact with the airflow, similarly to the term's use in aeronautics.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetted_area#cite_note-1)
