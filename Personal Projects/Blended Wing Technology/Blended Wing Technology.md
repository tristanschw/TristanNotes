"A **blended wing body** (**BWB**), also known as **blended body** or **hybrid wing body** (**HWB**), is a flying wing having no clear dividing line between the wings and the main body of the craft. The aircraft has distinct wing and body structures, which are smoothly blended together with no clear dividing line. This contrasts with a [[flying wing]] which has no distinct fuselage and a [[lifting body]], which has no distinct wings. A BWB design may or may not be tailess.

The main advantage of the BWB is to reduce [[wetted area]] and the accompanying [[form drag]] associated with a conventional wing-body junction. *It may also be given a wide airfoil-shaped body, allowing the entire craft to generate lift and thus reducing the size and drag of the wings.*

BWB is commonly found in underwater gliders and some aircraft.

Initial Questions:

**What is the commercial viability?**
Greater than 20% fuel savings
- above wing engines, opportunity to incorporate electric/hybrid electric engines (NASA measured 15db sound reduction compared to a 777)
- high seat capacity.
- greater lift/drag ratio
- significant payload improvements

With the benefits above, it poses an improvement in affordable air transport

***There just hasn't been any innovation in transport aircraft since the MD-11***

**What are potential issues**
- Stability control, many [[flying wing]] technologies are well understood (see [[B-2]]) and blended wing bodies have been experimented with (see [[X-48]])
- Accomodating different pressurization requirements due to the large interior
- Here are some others listed by Wikipedia which may just be simple engineering problems to solve:
-   Evacuating a BWB in an emergency could be a challenge. Because of the aircraft's shape, the seating layout would be theatre-style instead of tubular. This imposes inherent limits on the number of exit doors.
-   It has been suggested that BWB interiors would be windowless more recent information shows that windows may be positioned differently but involve the same weight penalties as a conventional aircraft.
-   It has been suggested that passengers at the edges of the cabin may feel uncomfortable during wing roll; however, passengers in large conventional aircraft like the 777 are equally susceptible to dutch roll.
-   The centre wingbox needs to be tall to be used as a passenger cabin, requiring a larger wing span to balance out.
-   A BWB has more empty weight for a given payload, and may not be economical for short missions of around four or fewer hours.
-   A larger wing span may be incompatible with some airport infrastructure, requiring [[folding wings]] similar to the Boeing777X
-   It is more expensive to modify the design to create differently-sized variants compared to a conventional fuselage and wing which can be stretched or shrunk easily.

**What happened to the X-48B program? Is anyone feeding off of this idea? (Boeing)**

Is a blended wing plane feasible today? What are the significant problems that pose a risk to develop the blended wing plane?

**What is the benefit? How much fuel savings per passenger? How fast could the plane travel? How high? Is it possible for the plane to be electric?**

Conventional tubular fuselage carry 12-13% of total lift
[[Center-body BWB]] carries 31-43% lift (though one that is similar to a narrow-body aircraft would be 25-32% of lift, leading to an 8% fuel efficiency increase)

According to "Beyond the Tube and Wing", aircraft efficiency as measured by ML/D (Mach*Lift/Drag) has been almost flat. 
**Is there any competition? What are they doing?**

**Similar Projects:**

**Airbus Maverick Program:**
- 20% fuel increase for the Maverick program (A BWB program they presented in 2020, along with a 6.5 feet long, 10.5-foot wingspan model at the Singapore Air Show)
- Hoped to replace a320-neo for short-range flights
- expected to reduce CO2 emissions by up to 50%

**X-47B:** Was a demonstration unmanned combat aerial vehicle, generally used to prove aerial refueling (this is a NG plane)
- fully autonomous, folded wingspan, 
First flew in 2011, demonstrators confirmed complete in 2015 and intended for a museum but the Navy kept them... why?

**X-47C:** Does not exist (yet, or might not ever according to wiki but Northrop said that the carrying capacity was up to 10,000lbs

**[[X-48]]:  Boeing X-48 is an American experimental unmanned aerial vehicle built tocharacterize the blended wing body design.**

**Northrop #B-2 Bomber:**

**Boeing:**
- 777x has folding wings, which may be something of a requisite for BWB

How can we develop a test plan to build this business?
