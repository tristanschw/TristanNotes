One of the three types of [[parasite drag]], [[form drag]] is the type of drag that occurs on an airfoil which arises from the shape of the airfoil. It varies based on the AoA and can be decreased through streamlining.

It's described as the resistance caused by an object's shape and profile as it moves through a fluid. For example, when air has to move around a moving aircraft, it eventually rejoins after passing the body. How quickly it rejoins is the representative resistance created, which requires additional force to overcome.
