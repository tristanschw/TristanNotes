[[interference drag]] comes from the intersection of airstreams that creates eddy currents, turbulence or restricts smooth airflow. 

A great example is the wing root (the intersection of a wing and the fuselage). This area has a significant interference drag. [[interference drag]] is maximized when two surfaces meet at perpendicular angles. 

[[interference drag]] is the main reason why [[fairings]] are used
