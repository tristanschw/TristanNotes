[[CAL Process]] [[Model 1]]

#Conclusion: 
[[Model 1]] 
After presentation to Hayden Taylor, we were told that we should continue to invest time into developing a theoretical model which can rigorously describe the situation of post processing. The model for drag force on a particle was not rigorous enough, and, as such, he believes that we can derive a more thorough equation which can account for the situation we are seeing. For the next iteration, see [[Model 2]]

Paper:
"Intermolecular attractions forces dominate, the net attractive force on a particle increases proportionally as particle size increases. Techniques that clean by centrifugal or impulse forces depond on the particle mass, which decreases with effective diameter cubed."

The Drag Force produced by shear stress cleaning depends on the particles projected frontal area, and decreases more slowly with the particle diameter squared.

Formulae: 
Relative Magnitude of Adhesion: We will never really know (supposedly impossible).

A stationary particle in a moving fluid stream will experience a drag force, due to the pressure exerted by the moving fluid and the friction between fluid moelcules and the particle skin as they flow around the particle. 

The magnitude of the drag force may be determined by: $F_D = C_p \frac{v^2}{2}A$ 

Where C is the drag coefficient, dependent on particle shape, particle surface roughness and other factors, rho is an gradient fluid density, V is the local fluid velocity around the particle, and A is the projected frontal area of the particle.

The objective: Increase the drag force to the point that it exceeds the force of adhesion. 

In general: To increase cleaning effectiveness, increase solvent density and increase local velocity, decrease fluid viscosity.

Insights: 
1. We need to know the particle size of the prepolmer resin. This will help us
	a. Deduce what velocity the fluid solvent must be to overcome the adhesive force to the surface. 
	b. The thickness of the "low-velocity sublayer" to prevent particle "hide-out"
2. We need to know the rough drag coefficient of a particulate (this will be difficult, but we can get some good estimates with more hours)
3. We need to come up with an experiment to actually test this.

Additional Thoughts on Practicality and Application:
1. Gradients of densities? Do we meddle with those details? That would make things very difficult
2. Varying thickness (and subsequent velocity) based on the geometry of the printed part

Shear Stress cleaning could be the way to "rinse" components; however, the method would pose significant technicalities to address varying geometries. In addition, it is the equivalent of using "subtractive" manufacturing methods for "additively" manufactured parts, which we know doesn't bode well. 

However, this research is not null, because if anything it helps address the amount of force needed to completely "rinse" a surface of prepolymer. We know that the effectiveness of a solvent is dependent on the zero-velocity layer, which is dependent on the fluid(solvent) velocity and density. This means that we can identify a solvent and a washing speed to effectively rinse the surface just by using the equations posed above.

A side thought in this: VAM (and really any SLA process) needs to not have a post-processing method. Any attempt to get rid of this would be great.
