Based on light deflection by a refractive index gradient.

BOS (Background Oriented Schlieren)
Pros: Few optical components because it is mostly computational
Simple Calibration
Potentially large field of view
Cons: 
Focus compromise with low to moderate sensititvtiy
Very susceptible to vibration.

Focused Schlieren:
Pros: Sharp image of refrative index distribution with high sensitivity
Cons: Many optical components to compensate for cylindrical lensing 
Focus adjustment and alignment of cutoff is critical
Reguires well collimated light.
