Glassomer is a high precision structural silica nanocomposite. A glass (can be liquid or solid). Potential to replace polymers and could be used in optics, photonic, medical and industrial application. Great machining properties, can be manufactured like a polymer (SNC, milled, turned, lasered etc)

[[SEM]] stands for scanning electron microscope, and is a type of electron microscope that produces images of a sample by scanning the surface with a focused beam of electrons. This is what we use to observe the microstructure of the printed parts down to 500 microns.
