Transient Flows

Using alternative [[Wavelengths]] to provide illumination for [[Shadowgraph]] or [[Particle Tracing]] (shorter wavelengths, potentially red)

How fast can we be rotating at 60Hz, 200 frames/s
Any particle has a tangential velocity, two cameras can be used if a light plane is used (determines verical and radial components)
