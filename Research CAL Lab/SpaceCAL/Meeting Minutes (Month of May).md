Glassblowing: 
Sorting out glass blowers for vial stack(s) in UW. 
Concerns:
- Cutting square to the axis 
- Cut to the diameter of the glass
	3D Printing Wedges for the glass tube attachments.
- Using a machine lathe to manufacture aluminum toolings

For parts not meant for machining:
- Walk through final BoM with Team to approve and submit order.

Optics:
- The optical set up (projector, lens, vial, lens) may be longer than expected

June 7th: **Meeting With Matthew** 
Topic: *What kind of Prints should we pursue*
- Demonstrate printing of similar components that are used in the FabLab, manufactured in the NASA solicitation
	- O-rings (concrete example of something that has to be replaced constantly)
	- (25%) Tensile specimens, coupons, to measure density and other factors
	- (75%) Experimental, demonstration factors
- Bioprinting, potentially can mention metrics that are important to the build volume. 
	- What is the largest component that we can print?
	- How can we ramp up the build rate
	- What is the scrap material percentage, percentage of resin that is cured versus the amount in the vial.
	- Material properties. What materials could we print that could also be helpful in space?
		Things we can print in:
		1. Flexible elastomers
		2. Glassomers (print, sinter)
		3. Multimaterial printing
- Applications for synthesizing polymers on a lunar or martian surface




$^[1]$ : OREM (*NASA*): When a component breaks on the ISS, the entire subassembly is replaced, since breaking into the subassembly to replace and o-ring or fitting would be difficult in micro-gravity.
