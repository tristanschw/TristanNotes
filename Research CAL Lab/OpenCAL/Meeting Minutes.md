Topic: OpenCAL Objectives and Design Methodology

- System 1: Breadboard Based System
	- Optimechanical parts, stages, ThorLabs components
	- Free adjustment of optical setup, projector, adding imaging system
	- Larger Budget ($ 3500-$4000)
- System 2:
	- Makers Space, more easily available to hobbyists and cutting costs
	- 3D printed components, semi-rigid, less adjustable
	- Smaller Budget ( )

Joe: Does not recommend custom manufactured components, mostly labs will be utilizing the technology who will have funding to build a CAL system. For those labs that are underfunded or only interested in experimentation. 
- Two systems? One purchased with commercial parts, one open to manufacturing in a  Makers Space which would intend to cut costs.
- Attempting to improve modularity is more difficult with system 2 for mating plastic parts.
- The simplest solution is a lateral stage

Taylor: Current CAL is majority 3D printed, but implementing system 2 would promote university collaboration. 
- Original CAL took a long time to revamp the CAD and fine tuning the CAL system took a few weeks

Kyle: Improve modularity
- Modularity would improve adjustability
- The CAL system is not tremendously complicated, but accuracy is a priority

Budget: 
- Some labs range costs of $4000, project is 25% of the cost
- Depending on the number of stages, each is $500

Stepper Motor:
- Only thing lost by a stepper is the loss of open aperature
- Motor built for optics is nice for unloading/loading vials

Vial Holder/Alignment
- 3 chuck system with magnets to slide it in and out
- DT80 Compact Rotation Stage

**Stepper**
microstepping, nanoteck (400 steps/rot) designed for NEMA 14 or 17 (whatever size)
use ender 3
nanotec (400 steps/rot)
