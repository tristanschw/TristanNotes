Polymeric Optical Materials: Higher refractive index, transparency in the visible spectrum, easily manufacturable
They are desired for microlenses, image sensors, OLEDs. Because acrylates are difficult to manufacture, a one-step approach is used to fabricate optical transparent polymers which reveal high refractive indices (1.6363 vs a low refractive index value of 1.50) at a constant wavelength 550nm (green light [[Visible light spectrum]])
