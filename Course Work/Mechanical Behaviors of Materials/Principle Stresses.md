**Principle Stresses** correspond to the normal stress on the planes where there is no shear. Take the stress tensor $\sigma _(ij)$ and *diagonalize* it to become an eigenvalue problem.

Then, the determinant is found, and the corresponding $\lambda$ values are combined to give the #invariants, $I_1 , I_2 , I_3$

*If there is an orthogonal, diagonalizable stress system, then the diagonals are the principle stresses.*

#invariants are useful because they can aid in determining the three #principlestresses which correspond to values unaffected by changing the coordinate system.

From the statement above, and simplifying the equation in image (2) we get:

where the roots of the equations ($\lambda$s) are the principle stresses.
