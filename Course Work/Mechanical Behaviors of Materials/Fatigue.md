**Factors that Affect Fatigue Life**

1. Mirror polish or mirror finishing to remove any surface stresses ![Ultra-Precise Mirror Polishing - Cactus Materials](https://www.cactusmaterials.com/uploads/9/1/7/2/91727356/editor/tdc-ultra-precise-with-ulti-qual.jpg?1509643366)
2. Fabrication, processing techniques that remove internal defects such as pores and microcracks.
3. Chamfering, which removes sharp corners and sharp changes in dimension (since these are areas of high stress)

4. Surface hardening (carburizing, quenching) to increase the surface strength ![Flame hardening of steel (surface hardening) - tec-science](https://www.tec-science.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/en-heat-treatment-steel-surface-hardening-flame-hardening.jpg)

**Gerber, Goodman and Soderberg Criteria for Fatigue**

#Goodman: ![[Pasted image 20210512143016.png]]

#Gerber: ![[Pasted image 20210512143039.png]]

#Soderberg: ![[Pasted image 20210512143027.png]]

Generally, the relationship between the criteria above and their corresponding factors of safety are: 
$x_{Soderberg} <= x_{Goodman} <= x_{Gerber}$

*Note: $S_y , S_u$ correspond to the yield and ultimate strength of a material obtained from a monotomic stress/strain test.*
