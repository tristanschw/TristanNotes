#Brittle 
* incapable of plastic deformation (ceramics)
* Use #MaxNormalStress crtieria to predict failure
* The yield point = fracture point = ultimate tensile strength = stress at fracture
* Decrease temperature, material becomes more brittle--> think about liquid nitrogen on a door lock and hitting it with a hammer. 
* Brittle materials are controlled by crack initiation and poor resistance to #fatigue at high strain (short lives). 

#Ductile
Temperature increases linearly with ductility. Increase temperature, increase ductility.

Ductile materials fail by yielding when the shear stress reaches a cricical value for dislocations to start sliding on slip planes along the slip directions.
