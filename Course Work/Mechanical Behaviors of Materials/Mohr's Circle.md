**Mohr's Circle** is a method used to find the stress components and coordinates of any point on the circle.

**Rules for Mohr's Circle**
1. Counterclockwise rotation corresponds to positive angle
2. Angles are all doubled on the Mohr's Circle
3. Points that directly oppose eachother (diametrically opposites) are 180$^{\circ}$ appart on the Mohr's Circle. However, in real life, they are 90$^{\circ}$ apart.

**Radius of Mohr's Circle:**$$R= \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_x - \sigma_y)^{2} + \tau _{xy}^{2}}$$
*Important to Note*: $\tau_{max} = R = \frac{\sigma_1 -\sigma_2}{2} = \frac{max - min principle stress}{2}$

**Average Stress (center of Mohr's Circle)**: $$\sigma_{avg}=\frac{\sigma_1 +\sigma_2}{2}=\frac{\sigma_x +\sigma_y}{2}$$

**Maximum Shear** $\tau_{max}$ is the largest radius of the Mohr's Circle
