Fatigue is caused by cyclic loadings, can be high or low cycle. Steel has a stronger resistance to low-cycle long life #fatigue (brittle materials do in general) Brittle materials are controlled by crack initiation and poor resistance to #fatigue at high strain (short lives). 

#Fatigue cracking is more likely to occur at edges and notches

The higher the stress amplitude, the shorter the #fatigue life

#Fatigue is a cumulative process, consists of crack initation, crack growth and fracture

**For a fracture test to be valid, the plastic stress zone size must be much much smaller than 
1) the radius of the notch 
2) 2) the thickness 
3) 3) the H and 4) the h. **

If the above are not satisfied, then the fracture test is contributing to yielding and not #fatigue, which is why the test becomes invalid. 

*If the #StressIntensityFactor is much smaller than the #fracturetoughness the crack will not propogate*

-- If the stress intensity factor (SIF) [[Fracture of Cracked Members]] is equal to the fracture toughness, the crack will propogate and Scratch will crack the iceberg and end the world.

-- Imagine if a shark tank was being made, and you wanted to make sure that even if the shark bites the tank, the tank wouldn't break. You could measure the fracture toughness of the material, you could determine the length of the crack initiated, and you could determine the critical length that would cause the crack to propogate. If this length is greater than the length of the bite--> the cage is safe!
the equation you would use is f*sigma*sqrt(pi*ac) = fracture toughness where ac is what you solve for
