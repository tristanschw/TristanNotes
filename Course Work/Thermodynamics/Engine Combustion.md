The gear ratio, is the ratio between the gears on an engine, to the wheels.
1st gear could correlate to a 1:1 ratio between the wheels, 6th to a 1:6.
I.e. one crankshaft rotation equates to 6 rotations of the tire.

A #combustionprocess is complete if all the carbon in the fuel burns to CO2, all the hydrogen burns to H20 and all the sulfur burns to SO2. Insufficient Oxygen is one reason for incomplete combustion, but it can also be attributed to dissociation caused at high temperatures. 

Of course, the theoretical air or stoichiometric amount always assumes complete combustion. 

Any extra air in the stoichiometric amount is called excess air, expressed as a percentage.
