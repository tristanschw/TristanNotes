Dimensional Analysis [[Dimensional Analysis -- A Note from Lecture]]
is the use of building an equation using input parameters to specify equations that have dimensionless units. 

the process is relatively straight forward, and is illustrated below:

1. Write the equation the given output and independent inputs
2. Write the dimensions using FLT or MLT forms
3. Specify the number of pi terms
4. The criteria for the pi terms is as followed:
		1. The output must be an independent
		2. Groupings (n^a*j^b*h^c) must have independent, non-repeating dimensions (they must contain FLT)
		3. Solve the system of equations for a,b,c, exponents. 

5. Check/ensure that the units cancel to a dimensionless pi term

*In the case that a model is used, the process is as follows*
1. Using the model parameters, write the largest (non-ratio) pi term
2. Equate this equation to the non-model equation
3. Solve 2. for the desired output variable
4. Plug in ratios for model to determine the desired model specifications (this could be the height of the tsunami in a videotaped model pool or the velocity of the large particle)
5. Remember: Dimensional Analysis speaks in ratios--they are approximations, not solutions
