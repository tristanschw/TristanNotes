Taylor (Coette- Taylor)
Russian (Sedov)
Dimensional analysis methods with non grouping independent variables is different than normal method

There is no difference when applying differential elements for $\Pi$ terms, simply a differential element can be added to whatever variable is being computed and the corresponding variable can be combined with others to produce a dimensionless term.
