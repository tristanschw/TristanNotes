#AcceleratingFrames
In some cases, accelerating frames should be avoided for momentum balance, because pseudo-forces will need to be accounted for. 

For **Mass Conservation**, an accelerating, constant velocity or inertial (static) frame can be used. The equation is the same for all control volume frames:
Equation 1: ![[Pasted image 20210510174530.png]]

*where we need to know how n^ and v in the moving frame depend on their values in the inertial frame (a1). Scalars such as Mass Rate (m*dot), rho, and A are the same in a moving and inertial frame. *

(a1): ![[Pasted image 20210510175216.png]] *This equation is the same, whether the control volume is accelerating or moving at a constant velocity*

The things that must be related are then only the velocity, v, and inward normal vector, n*hat.

"Generally, we will use the inertial frame"
