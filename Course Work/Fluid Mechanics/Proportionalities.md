If a ratio is (y/x) equal to a constant, then y is said to be directly proportional to x.
If (x*y)=constant, then it goes to say that y is inversely proportional to x. 

This is called direct proportionality

Velocity is inversely proportional to the square of diameter
--> That is to say, larger things fall faster

Drag Coefficient is inversely proportional to Reynolds number (generally)

For low reynold's numbers, Re<1000, force due to drag is linear with viscosity (by the Navier Stokes Relations)

In turbulences, drag force is largely independent from Reynold's Number
