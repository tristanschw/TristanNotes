#photometry: the study of how light interacts with geometry to give rise to images
#irradiance: [W/m^2] (image brightness) the amount of energy falling onto a small patch of the imaging sensor.
#thin-lens: (a model type) defined by an axis (optical axis), a focal plane (a plane perpendicular to the axis), and an optical center (the intersection of the optical plane and axis). Characterized only by focal length. 
- All rays entering the aperature are parallel to the optical axis
- All rays through the optical center are undeflected.

- Thin Lens Equation: $\frac{1}{Z}+\frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{f}$

#Euclidean-Transformation: $\lambda_2x_x = R\lambda_1x_1 +T$
where $x_2$, $x_1$ are measurements and $\lambda_{1,2}$, $T$ are unknowns
