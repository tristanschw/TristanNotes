- Describes that the apparent brightness of a unique surace to an observer is the same, regardless of the observer's angle of view. 
$$I_1(x_1)=I_2(x_2)$$


#Convolution with #Gassians
A **convolution** is the treatment of one matrix, M by another smaller matrix (the [kernal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(linear_algebra))). The result of a convolution is a filtered image matrix, $K*M$. The convolution is performed by sliding the kernel over the original image and taking the matrix dot product of the kernal and the part of the original matrix that it covers.
