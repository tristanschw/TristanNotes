#Servers/Requests/Services
Function: To execute calls in sequence, synchronously (server node is always keeping up to date with the calls of the client and vice versa)
Method:
	1. A client node requests a service from a server node
	2. The server node receives the requests, fulfills the service call, and returns a response to the client
	3. The client node receives the response and proceeds to next steps.
	
ROS Definition: 
- **Service types** are defined in a **.srv file** and are typically found under the srv directory in a package
	- **.srv file** contains requests (located above the -- line) and responses (below the -- line)
	- requests are in the same format as the TimeStampString.msg file (infact, they are identical to the messages used in ROS Topics, for example:

	- 
-**Service Nodes** are defined in a .py file.

[11-12] #wait_for_service() is used to block until a service is available (put this before you call a service using rospy.ServiceProxy)
	- rospy.wait_for_service(service,Â timeout=None) 

[14] #ServiceDefinition: A container for the request and response type. These must be used whenever we create or call a service. In this case, our Service Name is */turtle1/teleport_absolute* located in a **class** called *TeleportAbsolute*
