# TristanNotes

The human brain is non-linear: we jump from idea to idea, all the time. Your second brain should work the same.

Here is a repository of my notes which I take for classes, research, projects, and everything in between. 

You'll find that there is an influx of notes for topics I enjoy.

Consider this an opportunity to jump into my mind.
