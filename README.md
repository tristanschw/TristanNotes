# Brass 

Welcome to Brass. This is a directory of my Spring Semester Sophomore Year Notes. I make all my notes in Obsidian--a markdown file editing software which I use to prepare for interviews, talk about projects, and study for final exams. 

My favorite Folders from Brass are:

1. Brass --> CourseWork --> Mechanical Behaviors of Materials
2. Brass --> Research CAL Lab --> CALProcess
3. Brass --> Extra Curriculars --> Health and Wellbeing --> Sleep

Enjoy!
